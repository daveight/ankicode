# The Windows standalone_static distributions use the static CRT (/MT compiler
# flag). By default, Rust will build with the dynamically linked / DLL CRT
# (/MD compiler flag). `pyoxidizer build` should adjust RUSTFLAGS automatically
# when a standalone_static distribution is being used. But if invoking `cargo`
# directly, you'll need to override the default CRT linkage by either passing
# RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+crt-static" or by commenting out the lines
# below. Note that use of `target-feature=+crt-static` will prevent
# standalone_dynamic distributions from working.
#
# The standalone_static distributions also have duplicate symbols and some
# build configurations will result in hard linker errors because of this. We
# also add the /FORCE:MULTIPLE linker argument to prevent this from being a
# fatal error.

#[target.i686-pc-windows-msvc]
#rustflags = ["-C", "target-feature=+crt-static", "-C", "link-args=/FORCE:MULTIPLE"]

#[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
#rustflags = ["-C", "target-feature=+crt-static", "-C", "link-args=/FORCE:MULTIPLE"]
